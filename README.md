Go Vocal is a **digital democracy platform** that facilitates community participation and co-creation. Participants can post ideas, contribute to discussion, or choose to vote and prioritize community projects. Whether itâ€™s through a poll, a participatory budget, idea collection or a survey, the Go Vocal platform offers multiple ways to make your community participate, and manage their inputs effectively.

## Open-source model

Go Vocal adopts a so-called **[open-core model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-core_model)**, which means that there are two product editions available:

- Go Vocal Free Edition, contained in this repository. It includes all core functionalities, freely available under the AGPLv3 license. This edition is designed for small organisations running their next engagement project.
- Go Vocal Commercial Edition, including [extra features](https://www.govocal.com/plans) described under Standard/Premium, available by the paid commercial license. This edition is your best option if you plan to run many engagement projects, in order to have access to more back-office functionalities and manage your platform efficiently.

This code repository is organised and configured to get you started on the Free Edition of the Go Vocal software. To use the Commercial Edition or get professional support, consider [becoming a Go Vocal client](https://www.govocal.com/plans).
Looking for the source code of our source-available commercial edition? You can find it [here](https://github.com/CitizenLabDotCo/citizenlab).
